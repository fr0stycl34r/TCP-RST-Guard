          TCP RST GUARD

Introduction:

    TCP RST Guard is an experimental TCP option for preventing RST/FIN
attacks on established TCP connections. RST/FIN attack prevention is crucial
due to their ability to compromise the underlying internet routing
infrastructure of BGP routers. TCP RST Guard improves upon previous mechanisms
due to the fact it is backwards compatible, requires no changes to the basic
functioning of the TCP protocol, and only incurs overhead on connection setup
and teardown. 

Documentation:

    TCP_RST_Guard_-_draft.pdf is a paper detailing the reasoning behind 
TCP RST Guard as well as the proposed protocol, security analysis and 
evaluation of our implementation of the protocol in the Linux kernel.

Code:

    linux/linux-2.6.32 contains the source code for release 2.6.32 of the linux
kernel modified to support TCP RST Guard.
    linux/rst_guard_patch is a patch to the linux kernel containing the changes
to implement TCP RST Guard.
